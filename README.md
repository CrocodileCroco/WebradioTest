# WebradioTest
A live http radio/webradio test, all in python

# You will need
* Python 3, not 2
* FFMPEG
* Pydub, mutagen and Flask
* MP3 files

# Tutorial
First, download the repository onto your computer

Make a "audiofiles" folder and put your mp3 files in there (you can name it 1.mp3, 2.mp3, etc.. to make it play in order)

Run testradioweb.py (for the HTTP server) and testradio.py (for the radio itself)

Your radio should now be live 

(I have tested to listen to the radio with VLC and it works fine)

# Optional things to do
* Edit the program to play in random order or add a jingle between musics
* Change the URL in radio.m3u if necessary
